# HA-Energy-Dashboard
My homeassistant Energy Dashboard

Remember that you will need to change the entities to match what you want to display. You can do this in the yaml, or import the yaml first, then edit it in the UI editor.


For the battery charge/discharge time, I used a custom template macro, called 'Handy_time'. You can get that from here [Handy Time](https://github.com/philmale/handy-time)

I also highly recommend installing the following LoveLace mods, which is used in this dashboard. Without these mods, you will see unknown card type errrors.

Lovelace-card-mode
Lovelace-layout-card
Lovelace-state-swtich.
